detentions = ['Jenny', 'Corina', 'Jose', 'Osvaldo', 'Christian']
mins = 80

for student in detentions:
	print(student + ' has detention for ' + str(mins) + ' minutes.')
	mins = mins / 2

#1: Be the computer, print what the computer prints. (Use boxes for each variable!)
#2: Why, inside the 'for' loop, did we print the 'student' variable and not the 'detentions' variable?
